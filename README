This is a fork of Lua, modified to use turfs instead
of standard file I/O. It will probably also be further
modified in the future. Anyways, if you want to use
this fork, you also have to use turfs.

This is Lua 5.2.3, released on 11 Nov 2013.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.
